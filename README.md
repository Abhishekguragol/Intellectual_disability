# Intellectual_disability
Intellectual disability is a below average congnitive ability, which affects intelliegence and adaptive behaviors. The condition is chronic and can last for years or even be lifelong. However special education and behavioural therepy can help a person live to his or her fullest. In an effort to perform diagnosis to determine the onset of the disability at an early stage in life, we are developing a chat bot that a child can interact with, determining his/her ability to reason, plan, solve problems, learn quickly, comprehend ideas, and learn from experience. The chat bot will use age appropriate IQ tests, Q&amp;A sessions, quizes and games, inorder to test some of the previously mentioned parameters, and determine the severity of the condition. The bot will also interact with the parents to assess the behavioural characteristics of the child, to further aid the diagnosis.
